# Dialer-App
App for apple watch to make calls directly from the phone.
This app started its life as a proposal project for a texting app for watch before watchos 3 killed the market.  I made a little dialer app that allowed user to place phonecalls to raw phone numbers directly from apple watch.  This function is still not a part of watch os.  It is purely a showcase with mobile data sharing and call access in watch os.
